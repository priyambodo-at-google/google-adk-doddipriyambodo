Foundations with Google's ADK: Master the fundamentals of building your first intelligent agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Understand the essential components, the agent lifecycle, and how to leverage the framework's built-in tools effectively.

Extending Agent Capabilities with Model Context Protocol (MCP): Learn to equip your agents with custom tools and context, enabling them to perform specialized tasks and access specific information. Introduce the Model Context Protocol (MCP) concept. You'll learn how to set up an MCP server to provide this context.

Designing Agent Interactions & Orchestration: Move beyond single agents to understand agent orchestration. Design interaction patterns ranging from simple sequential workflows to complex scenarios involving loops, conditional logic, and parallel processing. Introduce the concept of sub-agents within the ADK framework to manage modular tasks.

Building Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems: Discover how to architect systems where multiple agents collaborate to achieve complex goals. Learn and implement the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol, establishing a standardized way for distributed agents (potentially running on different machines or services) to interact reliably.

Productionizing Agents on Google Cloud: Transition your agent applications from development environments to the cloud. Learn best practices for architecting and deploying scalable, robust multi-agent systems on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Gain insights into leveraging GCP services like Cloud Run and explore the capabilities of the latest Google Agent Engine for hosting and managing your agents.
